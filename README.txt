anyInventory Inventory System
=============================
Thank you for downloading anyInventory, a flexible inventory system
that can be used by anyone to track anything.  Because anyInventory
is designed in a way that allows the user to decide what type of 
information to keep track of, it is powerful enough to inventory items
from the food in your refrigerator to the stock of a department store.

Installation
============
To install anyInventory, uploade the included files to your Web server 
and then run the included install.php script from the Web browser of 
your choice.  (We heartily recommend Mozilla: http://www.mozilla.org/.)

If you do not wish to allow anyone who can view your inventory to add or
edit it, you can password protect the admin directory to disallow access
to these functions.

Using anyInventory
==================
The best place to start is with the "Instructions for Use," found in the
docs subdirectory and linked from the main menu of anyInventory.  If all
of your questions are not answered there, you can view the project page
at http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/anyinventory/.  Also, you can
contact chris@efinke.com for help with anything related to anyInventory;
all comments and questions are welcomed.
